   <blockquote><h1>Backtracking</h1></blockquote>
    <br>
    <blockquote>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</blockquote>
    
   <blockquote> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options,and you must choose one of these .After you make your
    choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made.This 
    procedure is repeated over and over untill you reach a final state . If you made a good sequence of choices ,your 
    final state is goal state ; if you didn't, it isn't. </blockquote>
    
   <blockquote> Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree ; the tree probably has some good leave and some bad leaves , through
    it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf . At each node, beginning with the 
    root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this untill you get to a leaf.</blockquote>
    
   <blockquote> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. you can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent 
    choice,and trying out the next option in that set of options. if you run out of options ,revoke the choice that you 
    got here, and try another choice at that node. if you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves
    to be found.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>This needs an example.</blockquote>

        <p class="silver-text"> Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function . this is essential to understanding the algorithm.
        if solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a part from 
        the root to some goal node. we say that n is solvable. if solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes 
        n to any goal node.

        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to goal node),all you have to do is test 
        whether any child of n is solvable. this is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by

    The Backtracking algorithm is simple but important. you should understand it throughly. Another way of starting 
    it is as follows:

    <blockquote><h3>To search a tree:</h3>
    1. If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.<br></br>
    2. Otherwise, search the subtrees untill you find one containing a goal node, or untill you have searched them all 
      unsucessfully.
      <h3>Non-recursive Backtracking, using a stack</h3>
      <textarea rows="17" cols="80">
           boolean solve (Node n){
            put node n on the stack;
            while the stack is not empty{
                if it is a goal node, return true 
                else pop it off the stack
            }
            else {
                if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                  push the next untried child onto the stack 
                 else pop the node off the stack 

            }
            return false
           }
      </textarea>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
            Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node
            currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence,the nodes on the 
            stack at all time describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known
            that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the 
            stack empty),there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
            <br><br>
            when the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from
            the root to a goal node.
            <br></br>
            Similarly,when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order)
            in the sequence of recursive calls. thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a 
            time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in arrray.
            <br></br>
            Here is the recursive Backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along 
            the succesfull path :

            <h3>Keeping Backtracking simple</h3>
            All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem,
            they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
            <br></br>
            for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the 
            checkmate and stalemate solutions
            <br></br>
            To keep the program clean, Therefore, test like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for 
            example, you could test whether a node is leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call 
            it <b>isLeaf</b>). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible 
            moves remain.
            <br></br>
            Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which 
            of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this 
            look simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n</b>. In reality,it may be dificult to figure out what the
            possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node
            can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. how do you find these children, and how 
            do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
            <br></br>
            The most straight forward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
            initial entry to the node (that is,when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children.As you
            try each child, take it off the list. when the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you 
            can return "failure". This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
            <br></br>
            There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
            children. if there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to
            try next.
            <br></br>
            For Example, yet might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order.then,
            if you have just tried <b>Child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children <b>k-1,</b> and you have 
            not tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b>Or,if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you 
            can always try <b>red first,then yellow,then green,then blue.</b> if child yellow fails,you know to try child 
            green next. if you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left,straight,right <b>(or perhaps
            north,east,west,south).</b>
            <br></br>
            it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b>
            you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order,but in
            addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Example:Tree Search</h3>
            For starters,let's do the simplest possible example of Backtracking,which is searching an actual tree.We will
            also use the simplest kind of tree; a binary tree.
            <br></br>
            A binary tree is a Data strucure composed of nodes. one node is designated as the root node. Each node can 
            reference (point to) zero,one or two nodes, which are called its children. the children are reffered to as 
            the left child. All nodes are reacheable (by one or more steps) from the root node,and there are no cycles.
            For our purposes,althrough this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that node might 
            or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat
            here) shows a binary tree.
            <br></br>
            Here's a Definition of the Binary Tree class:
            <br></br>
            <textarea rows="15" cols="85">

                public class Binary Tree{
                    Binary Tree leftChild = null;
                    Binary Tree rightChild = null;
                    boolean isGoalNode = false;
                    String name;;
                
                    Binarytree(String name,Binary Tree right,boolean isGoalNode){
                        this.name=name;
                        leftChild=left;
                        rightchild=right;
                        this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
                    }
                }
            </textarea> 
            <br></br>
            Next we will create a TreeSearch class,and in it we will define a method make tree() which constructs the above binary tree.
            <br></br>
            <textarea rows="12" cols="85">

                static BinaryTree make Tree() {
                    c= new Binary Tree("C",null,null,false);
                    d= new Binary Tree("D",null,null,false);
                    e= new Binary Tree("E",null,null,false);
                    f= new Binary Tree("F",null,null,false)
                    a= new Binary Tree("A",c,d,false);
                    b= new Binary Tree("B,e,f,false");
                    root= new Binary Tree("Root",a,b,false);
                    return root;
                }
            </textarea>
            <br></br>
            Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:
            <br></br>
            <textarea rows="6" cols="85">

                public static void main(string args[]) {
                    BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
                    System.out.printIn(solvable(tree));
                }
            </textarea>
            <br></br>
            And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.
            <br></br>
            <textarea rows="15" cols="85">

                static boolean solvable(Binary Tree node){

                    /*1*/ if (node==null) return false;

                    /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

                    /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                    
                    /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                    
                    /*5*/ return false;

                }
            </textarea>
            <br></br>
            Here's what the numbered lines are doing:
            <br></br>
            1. If we are given a null node,it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the 
              children of a node,without first checking whether those children actually exist.
              <br></br>
            2. if the node we are given is a goal node, return success.
            <br></br>
            3. See if the left child of a node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. we will only get to this line 
              if node is non-null and is not a goal node,says to 
              <br></br>
            4. Do the same thing for the right child.
            <br></br>
            5. Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.
            <br></br>
            Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. in the above we put that check as the first thing in 
            solvable . An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do.Here's that alternative version:
            <br></br>
            <textarea rows="15" cols="95">

                static boolean solvable (Binary Tree node){

                if (node isGoalNode) return true;

                if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

                if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;

                return false;

                }
                

            </textarea>
            <br></br>
            I think the the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.
            <br></br>
            <hr>
            <h3>What are the children ?</h3>
            <br></br>
            One of the things that simplifies the above binary search tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices
            .Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as for as you know ,both the left and the right child are possible solutions.
            In many problems ,however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately,without recursion.
            <br></br>
            Consider, for example, the problem of four-colouring a map. it is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convulted the countries are,
            can be coloured with at most four colors , so that no two countries that share a border are of the same color.
            <br></br>
            To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country ,and so on ,untill all countries are colored.
            <br></br>
            There are two ways to do this:

                <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. when you run out of the countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent countries, and recur. if and when you run out of countries, you 
                    have succesfully coloured the map.
                </li>
            </uL>
            <br></br>
            Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkboard only needs two colors.
            <br></br>
             <span style="font-size: large;"><b>boolean maplsOK()</b></span>
             <br>
             used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.
             <br></br>
             <span style="font-size: large;"><b>boolean okToColor(int row,int column,int color)</b></span>
             <br>
             Used by method 2 to check, at every node,whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
             <br></br>
             <span style="font-size: large;"><b>int[] next RowAndColumn(int row,int column)</b></span>
             <br>
             Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the Checkerboard).
             <br></br>
             <br></br>
             Here's the code for method 1:
             <br></br>
             <textarea rows="21" cols="90">

                boolean explore1(int row,int column,int color){

                     map[row][column] = color;

                    for(int nextColor = RED;nextColor <= BLUE; nextCOLOR++){

                        int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);

                        if (explore(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;

             <br></br>
             Here's the code for method 2:

      <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>  
      often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. there are some 
      simple tricks to making effective use of print statements .these tricks can be applied to any programs, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Trick#1: Indent when you print method entries and exists.</h3>   
      Often, the best debugging techniques is to print every method call and return (or at last the most important ones). you probably want to print, for each method,what methods, what methods 
      what parameters it comes in with , and what values it leave with. However, if you just print long list of these, it's hard to match up method exists with their corresponding entries.
      indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
      <br></br>
      <br></br> 
      <h3>Trick#2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>      
      Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must.Also, remember that code inserted for Debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can effect the result,so 
      be very carefull with it.
      <br></br>
      Here's our debugging code.for this trivial program,there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.
      <br></br>
      <textarea rows="45" cols="90">


        static string indent  = "";


        static string name (Binary Tree node){

            if (node == null) return null;

            else return node.name;

        }


        static void enter (Binary Tree node ){

              System .out.print (indent + "Entering solvable ("+ name(node)+")");

        }


        static void enter (Binary Tree node){

            indent = indent.substring(3);

            System .out.print (indent + "solvable("+ name(node)+")return true");

            return true;

        }


        static boolean no(Binary Tree node){

            indent = indent.substringa(3);

            System.out.print(indent + solvable ("+ name(node) + ") returns false");

            returns false;

        }

      </textarea> 
      <br></br> 
      To use this code, we modify aolvable as follows:
      <br></br> 
      <textarea rows="18" cols="90">

        static boolean solvable(Binary tree node){

            enter(node);

            if (node == null) return no(node);

            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);

            if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);

            if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);

            return no(node);

        }
      </textarea>
      <br>
      And we get these results:
      <br></br>
      <pre>
      Entering solvable(Root)
      |Entering solvable(A)
      ||Entering solvable(C)
      |||Entering solvable(null)
      |||solvable(null)returns false
      |||Entering solvable(null)
      ||solvable(C) returns false 
      ||Entering solvable(D)
      |||Entering solvable(null)
      |||solvable(null) returns false
      |||Entering solvable(null)
      |||solvable(null) returns false
      ||solvable(D) returns false
      |solvable(A) returns false
      |Entering solvable(B)
      ||Entering solvable(E)
      ||Solvable(E) returns true
      |solvable(B) returns true
      solvable(Root) returns true
      true
     </pre>
     <br></pre>
     <h3>Trick#3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
     writing debugging statements is programming,too. often it's as much work to debugg the debugging statements as it is to debugg the actual program.once your program is working why
     throe this code away?
     <br></br>
     The simple is to make your debugging statements conditional.For example,
     <br></br>
     <textarea rows="30" cols="90">

        static final boolean debugging = false;


        static void enter(Binary Tree node){

            if debugging {

                System.out.print(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name (node)+")"):

                indent = indent + "|";

            }

        }
        
        static boolean yes (Binary Tree node){

            if (debugging){

                indent = indent.substring(3);

                System.out.print(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");

            }

        }
     </textarea>
     <br></br>
     In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging.Don't worry too much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that Since
    the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded. 
    <br></br>

    <h2>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h2><br></br>
    I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which 
    consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left),the white marbles all at the other end , and a free space in 
    between.
    <img src="Screenshot (117).png" position="center">
    <br></br>
    <h4>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).At each move, a marbles can either: </h4>
    <uL>
        <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
        <br></br>
        <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>
    </uL>
    <br></br>
    for example, you could make the following sequence of moves:
    <br></br>
    <img src="Screenshot (119).png" position="center">
    <br></br>

    <br></br>
    The Backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. in solvable we shall need to check whether we are at leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are 
    possible . this isn't so easy.
    <br></br>
    Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board,and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succed 
    and print out a winning path, or it will fall, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.
    <br></br>
    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no futher moves 
    are possible This isn't so easy.
    <br></br>
    Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board position are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board 
    position),we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
    <br></br> 
    here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress,we must analyze the game to some extent. probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way i worked 
    out. if you where to program this puzzle,you might find a different equaliy valid approach.
    <br></br> 
    First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it can not jump. if it can jump,it cannot move ahead one square.This suggests that,to find 
    the possible moves ,we assign number to the marbles and check each marble in turn when we look at all the marbles , we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table 
    to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "making" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.
    <br></br> 
    <B>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our programs.just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. for each space, either zero or moves is possible. With this understanding 
        ,we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
    </B>
    <br></br> 
    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li> <br></br> 
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right</li> <br></br> 
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li> <br></br> 
    </ul>
    <br></br> 












 Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>PuzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that should be obvious. <br></br>
 <textarea rows="32" cols="90">

 Here is some output from the program:
 <br></br>
 <img src="Screenshot (121).png">
 <br></br>
 <p class="silver-text"> Notice that the solution is given in reverse order:Black starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line i've added line numbers to the actual 
    output in order to emphatesize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again 
    to get them in the correct order.
